# Progress

## What Works

- The core chatbot functionality is working, allowing users to ask questions and receive responses based on the selected debater's knowledge.
- The debate simulator is functional, orchestrating debates between multiple debaters using LangGraph.
- The system is able to retrieve relevant information from the Pinecone vector database.
- The system is able to generate responses using Google Generative AI.
- Password protection is implemented.
- Feedback submission is implemented.

## What's Left to Build

- Further refinement of the prompts to improve the quality and accuracy of the responses.
- Potential enhancements to the debate simulator, such as adding more complex debate rules or user interaction.
- Explore the use of Google Sheets connection.

## Current Status

- The Memory Bank is being populated with project details.
- All code files have been analyzed.
- The `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` files have been populated.

## Known Issues

- The `replace_in_file` tool has been failing due to exact match issues, requiring the use of `write_to_file` as a fallback.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The project initially seemed to focus solely on the chatbot functionality, but it was later discovered that it also includes a separate debate simulator application.
- The decision to use Pinecone namespaces for each debater was a key architectural choice.
- The decision to load API keys from Streamlit secrets was important for security.
